"""
Feature computation engine.

Single chronological pass. For each transaction, features are computed
against the state accumulated from *strictly earlier* transactions, and
only then is that transaction folded into the state. This ordering is the
structural guarantee against temporal leakage — there is no code path that
can see a future row, because future rows have not been processed yet.

That is a deliberate trade against vectorised pandas operations, which are
faster but make it very easy to accidentally compute a statistic over the
whole column (including the future) and then use it per-row. At S40's
prototype scale correctness is worth far more than the speed difference.

Features whose inputs the canonical data cannot supply are NOT computed
and NOT imputed. They are listed in UNAVAILABLE_SPEC_FEATURES so the gap
stays visible.
